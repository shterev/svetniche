# Code Quality & Best Practices

**IMPORTANT: These rules apply to code quality, organization, and development standards.**

## Auto-Apply Scope
- Applies to all TypeScript and JavaScript files
- Automatically enforced during code development
- Reference these rules before making any significant code changes

## Code Simplicity & Reuse
- **Always look for existing code to iterate on** instead of creating new code
- **Do not drastically change patterns** before trying to iterate on existing patterns
- **Always prefer simple solutions** - Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- **Avoid duplication of code whenever possible** - Check for similar functionality

## Code Syntax & Style
- **Always use short syntax when possible** - Prefer concise arrow function syntax
  - ❌ BAD: `(arg) => { return value; }`
  - ✅ GOOD: `(arg) => value`
- **Remove unnecessary braces** and return statements in arrow functions
- **Keep code concise and readable**
- **Always clean up unused imports**
- **Always clean up unused code** - Remove dead code regularly

## TypeScript Best Practices
- **Never use `any` as TypeScript type** - Always use proper typing
- **Use strict TypeScript configuration** for better code quality
- **Leverage TypeScript's type system** for better development experience

## Architecture & Patterns
- **Do not introduce new patterns or technology** without exhausting existing options
- **Remove old implementation** when introducing new patterns to avoid duplicate logic
- **Avoid making major changes to proven patterns** unless explicitly instructed
- **Follow SOLID principles** in code design

## File Organization
- **Avoid files over 200-300 lines of code** - Refactor at that point
- **Don't create index files** to export files in the same folder
- **Keep the codebase very clean and organized**
- **Maintain logical file structure** and naming conventions

## Environment Considerations
- **Write code for different environments**: dev, test, and prod
- **Never add stubbing or fake data patterns** to code affecting dev or prod
- **Mocking data is only needed for tests** - Never mock data for dev or prod

## Testing Requirements
- **Write thorough tests** for all major functionality
- **Ensure test coverage** for critical business logic
- **Use appropriate testing strategies** for different code types

## Change Management
- **Focus on areas relevant to the task**
- **Do not touch code unrelated to the task**
- **Always think about what other methods/areas might be affected** by changes
- **Be careful to only make requested changes** or well-understood related changes

## Script Guidelines
- **Avoid writing scripts in files if possible** - especially one-time scripts
- **Consider dedicated script directories** for utility scripts
- **Document script purposes and usage** when necessary

## Comment Guidelines
- **Add comments only when complex logic is applied**
- **Write self-documenting code** when possible
- **Use comments to explain "why" not "what"**
- **Keep comments concise and relevant**
- **Update comments when code changes**
