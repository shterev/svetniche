# Hook Structure

**IMPORTANT: These rules apply when creating or organizing React hooks.**

## Auto-Apply Scope
- Applies to all custom React hooks in the project
- Automatically enforced when creating new hooks
- Ensures consistent organization and maintainability

## Hook Folder Structure

### One Hook Per Folder Pattern
- **Each hook MUST be in its own folder** - Follow the same pattern as components and utils
- **Folder name matches hook name** - Use the exact hook name for the folder (e.g., `useGeolocation`)
- **Hook file inside folder** - Place the hook implementation file inside its folder
- **Include index.ts** - Export the hook from an index.ts file

### Example Structure

```
src/hooks/
  useGeolocation/
    - useGeolocation.ts
    - index.ts
  useWeatherForecast/
    - useWeatherForecast.ts
    - index.ts
```

### File Contents

**Hook file (useGeolocation.ts):**
```typescript
// Hook implementation with all types and logic
export function useGeolocation() {
  // ... implementation
}
```

**Index file (index.ts):**
```typescript
export { useGeolocation } from "./useGeolocation";
```

## Hook Naming Convention
- **Hook names start with "use"** - Follow React hooks naming convention
- **Use camelCase** - e.g., `useGeolocation`, `useWeatherForecast`
- **Descriptive names** - Hook name should clearly describe its purpose

## Import Pattern
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Import from hook folder
import { useGeolocation } from "../../hooks/useGeolocation";
import { useWeatherForecast } from "../../hooks/useWeatherForecast";

// ❌ WRONG: Don't import directly from file
import { useGeolocation } from "../../hooks/useGeolocation/useGeolocation";
```

## Benefits
- **Consistent with components and utils** - Same folder pattern across the codebase
- **Easy to locate** - Each hook is in its own dedicated folder
- **Scalable** - Easy to add hook-specific tests, types, or utilities in the future
- **Clean imports** - Index files provide clean import paths
- **Better organization** - Hooks can grow with related files without cluttering

## When Creating New Hooks
1. Create a new folder in `src/hooks/` with the hook name
2. Create the hook file inside the folder (e.g., `useCustomHook.ts`)
3. Create an `index.ts` file that exports the hook
4. Implement the hook logic in the hook file
5. Import the hook using the folder path

- See `single-responsibility.mdc` for utility folder structure
- Follow the same principles: one folder per unit of functionality
